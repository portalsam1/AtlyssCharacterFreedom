# AtlyssCharacterFreedom

This mod disables clamping for character body values, it also adjusts the default max values for some of the sliders.<br />
Currently other people also need to have the mod for them to be able to see changes larger than vanilla.<br /><br />

If the default values bother you, or you'd want to go higher you can change them in the Config (BepInEx/config/net.portalsam.AtlyssCharacterFreedom.cfg):
