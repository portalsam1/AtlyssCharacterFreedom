[Thunderstore Link](https://thunderstore.io/c/atlyss/p/portalsam/AtlyssCharacterFreedom/)

This mod disables clamping for character body values, it also adjusts the default max values for some of the sliders.<br />
Currently other people also need to have the mod for them to be able to see changes larger than vanilla.<br />

## Where is the .DLL?
The [Releases](https://github.com/portalsam1/AtlyssCharacterFreedom/releases) tab, it's on the right with the green text that says "Latest".

## Install
[Install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) and place the .dll file into the BepInEx/plugins folder. You may need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

## Some sliders don't work!
"Limit Character Proportions" must be disabled in the game settings. Try this and then if it doesn't work please make a GitHub issue.
