# AtlyssCharacterFreedom

This mod disables clamping for character body values, it also adjusts the default max values for some of the sliders.<br />
Currently other people also need to have the mod for them to be able to see changes larger than vanilla.<br />

## Install
[Install BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) and place the .dll file into the BepInEx/plugins folder. You may need to create this folder if it does not already exist.
